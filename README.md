# Quizzler

This app helped me to grasp the fundamentals of Constraints and, most importantly, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which optimized my code and made it more readable. Through this pattern, I delved into the concepts of structures, Swift Classes, and Objects.

The app itself is a Quiz, where users are presented with three answer options, and the correct answers are tallied in the Score displayed at the top. Throughout the development of this app, I gained insights into:

* Programmatically changing UI elements, such as Labels and Buttons.
* Understanding the purpose and usage of design patterns in programming.
* Leveraging the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for efficient app development.
* Exploring Swift Structures and understanding how to instantiate a struct instance.
* Distinguishing between value types and reference types in Swift.
* Working with Swift Classes and creating Objects.
* Comparing Swift Classes with Swift Structs and discerning when to use each.
* Embracing Object-Oriented Programming principles.
* Refactoring code to maintain organization and clarity.

This project was instrumental in solidifying my understanding of these key concepts in iOS app development.
